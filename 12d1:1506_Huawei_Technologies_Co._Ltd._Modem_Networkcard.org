The star(=*=) ones is in my experience required to get this chip to work, and
the module(=M=) ones seems handy and does hurt to have.

** wvdial/ppp
: $ cat /etc/wvdial.conf
: [Dialer Defaults]
: Init1 = ATZ
: Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0
: Init3 = AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","internet.telenor.se","",0,0
: Phone = *99#
: Modem Type = Analog Modem
: Baud = 9600
: Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0
: ISDN = 0
: Username = 4G
: Password = 4G
: Stupid Mode = 1

Username and Password seems to not matter, but I have read it *should* be 4G:4G
when using Telenor as operator.

** Eventual modeswitching
Does not seem to be required to do by hand anymore, but just for reference from
my first experience when I first got this thing to work...

Modem showed up as =12d1:1505= and needed to be [[http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/bb/viewtopic.php?t=669&sid=c9579fe9d25c8377eb8f572e657b751a][modeswitched]] to be =12d1:1506=.

But modeswitch is patched since a good while.
